This study provides an updated summary of the effects of different chemistry applied sequentially (three sprays starting at the heading stage) for managing wheat blast (caused by *Pyricularia oryzae Triticum* lineage). For such, we gathered data from 44 uniform field trials conducted during nine growing seasons (2012-2020) across several wheat-producing states in Brazil. Additionally, we evaluated whether the estimates of control efficacy and yield response varied over time, space, and on different levels of disease or yield; and calculated fungicide profitability based on the break-even probabilities.
